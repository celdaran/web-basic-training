<h1>Sample HTML Elements</h1>
<p>This page describes the most commonly used HTML elements.</p>

<h2>Text</h2>

<h3>Paragraphs</h3>
<p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in
    Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with
    the necessary regelialia.</p>
<p>It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing
    has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum
    decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question
    Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself
    on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the
    headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.</p>

<h3>Inline semantics</h3>
<p>Here are some common formatting tags:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Bold</b></li>
    <li><strong>Strong</strong></li>
    <li><u>Underline</u></li>
    <li><i>Italics</i></li>
    <li><em>Emphasis</em></li>
    <li><s>Strikethrough</s></li>
    <li>Subscript<sub>12</sub></li>
    <li>Superscript<sup>34</sup></li>
    <li><a href="#">Link</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Content</h3>
<p>The following is a blockquote tag:</p>
<blockquote>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</blockquote>
<p>The following is pre-formatted text:</p>
<pre>
    Whatever shows up in here, is
      rendered exactly as shown.
        Line breaks and other whitespace
      are
    preserved.

    function square(int x): int
    {
      return x * x;
    }

</pre>
<p>Note that a line can be broken without having to start a new paragraph using the <br>tag. See how that's different<br>from another paragraph? As shown below?</p>
<p>A horizontal line can be added with the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> tag:</p>
<p>This is <code>more code</code>. I hope you liked it.</p>

    <li>Doing Dishes</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Sub Item 1</li>
        <li>Sub Item 2</li>
        <li>Sub Item 3</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Lists: Ordered</h3>
<p>An ordered list uses numbers:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Entertaining Elephants</li>
    <li>Forever Fooling</li>
    <li>Getting Giggles</li>
    <li>Having Headaches</li>
</ol>

<!--p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and
    feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the
    exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.</p> <p>I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and
    yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the
    upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the
    tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the
    little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the
    Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath

<p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like
    back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was
    hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved
    about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small,
    lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman -
    and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady
    fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor
    then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops</p-->
